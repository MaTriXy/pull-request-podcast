Why web scraping still matters (lack of APIs, need for data)
The Apify platform - actors, datasets and runs
Examples of popular actors (Google, Yelp, Zillow, LinkedIn, Wolt)
The "Crawler" actor - a great way to scrape entire websites
Playwright and Puppeteer integration
Using Apify proxies (datacenter, residential)
Using Apify proxies outside of Apify platform (i.e in Axios)
Build your own actor and monetize
