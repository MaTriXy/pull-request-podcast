What Are Embeddings?
Core Use Cases
Common Techniques & traditional models (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
LLMs (BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, OpenAI, etc.)
Capturing Context and Semantics
Dimensionality & Efficiency (including trade-offs)
Similarity searches using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance
Custom and Domain-Specific Embeddings
Fine-tuning or training embeddings from scratch on domain-specific data
Advanced usages for Embeddings (beyond text)
