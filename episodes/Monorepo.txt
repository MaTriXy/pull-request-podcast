Benefits vs. single-repo or multi-repo
Use concrete examples for Node.js (NPM/pnpm/yarn) and Python (pip)
Store all projects, libraries, and services in a single repository for a single source of truth
Make consistent, atomic commits that span multiple applications or modules, reducing integration issues
Share and version dependencies and common libraries effortlessly across teams
Apply uniform build, test, linting, and deployment setups with centralized configuration management
Improve developer awareness of changes across projects, fostering collaboration and consistent coding practices
Efficiently update and refactor shared code and APIs across multiple projects with confidence
Utilize tools like Bazel, Nx, Lerna, or Pants to execute incremental builds and tests, optimizing performance
Streamline branch management and merges to reduce integration conflicts and maintain code quality
Centralize test suites and CI pipelines, enabling comprehensive and faster regression testing
Promote reuse of code patterns and libraries, reducing duplication and maintaining consistency across applications
Leverage automated tools to map interdependencies, ensuring efficient build and deployment pipelines
Employ strategies like selective checkouts, caching, and distributed builds to address performance challenges in very large repositories
